This website is built on the foundation of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
It uses the concept of static content, generated from simple input formats like
[Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and HTML. The final content gets
created via templates using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as site generator.

For the discussions and comments on blog posts this site uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
as platform.
